	//Key words
	
	//Identifiers are names 
		//Identifiers are names given to classes, variables, methods
	//variables for names or classes cannot be created using JAVA key words
		//Identifiers cannot start with numbers 
		//Identifiers cannot contain spaces but they can have underscores_ or $$$
		//Identifiers cannot have special character@#&*(
		
		
		//DO NOT use key words as identifiers
		//For example :
		/*
		 * classes cannot be named super for example. 
		 * 
		 * 
		 * short 1b=1; FALSE doesn't work
		 * short b1=1; TRUE will work, yes
		 * 
		 * int final =10; FALSE INVALID, final is a key word
		 * 
		 */
		
		//Naming Conventions Standards (not a rule, a convention)
		/*
		 * 1. We can use camelCasing yesWeCan
		 * 
		 * 2. Classes will StartWithUpperCasing
		 * 
		 * 3. Variables start with lowerCase 
		 * 
		 * For example : 
		 * 
		 * int Number1 =1; FALSE 
		 * int number1=1; TRUE
		 * 
		 * int numberOne=1; TRUE
		 * int numberTwo=2;TRUE
		 * 
		 * boolean isSnow = TRUE; TRUE 
		 * 
		 *  double applePrice = 90.90;
		 *  double mangoPrice = 100.10;
		 *  
		 *  4. String variables will be typed with upper case
		 *  
		 *  For example :
		 *  
		 * String Yay;
		 * 
		 * 
		 * /
